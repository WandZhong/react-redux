-----------------------


Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. With Truffle, you get:

* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
* A configurable build pipeline that supports both web apps and console apps.
* Generators for creating new contracts and tests (like `rails generate`)
* Instant rebuilding of assets during development (`truffle watch`)
* Console to easily work with your compiled contracts (`truffle console`)
* Script runner that lets you run JS/Coffee files with your contracts included (`truffle exec`)
* Contract compilation and deployment using the RPC client of your choice.
* Support for JavaScript, CoffeeScript, SASS, ES6 and JSX built-in.
